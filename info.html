        About <br><br>
        <u>Heather Mitchell</u> is a new media artist currently based in the California Bay Area from Ottawa, Canada.<br><br>
        
        She creates work which finds emotional and narrative entryways into the vast complex systems of computation which create our daily realities. Working across the mediums of sound, image, installation and performance she looks for human emotion and desire reflected back to us from the worlds which have been created through philosophies of binary logic and a culture of belief in scientific-objectivity.
